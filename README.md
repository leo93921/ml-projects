# Machine Learning Projects
This is a list of projects developed for the `High Performance Computing` and `Estimation and Data Analysis with Applications` courses. They are about Regression and Classification problems.

They show how to use different models like:
- for regression problems, Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression have been used, using regularization to prevent overfitting.
- for classification problems, different models havr been used, like:
  - Logistic Regression;
  - Random Forest;
  - Extra-tree;
  - LGBM;
  - CatBoost;
  - Model Ensemble.
  
  For these models, different performance metrics were used, such as Area Under the ROC curve, Precision and Recall.

For each project, a phase of features analysis and features engineering has been carried out.
See the `kaggle-santander-competition` notebook, which is the most complete notebook and a real-world example.
